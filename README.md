# learnWebdev  

This repository contains my **Web Development practice** focusing on **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## Structure  

The project is organized into two root folders:  

1. **brocode/** – Daily practice files following Bro Code’s YouTube tutorials:  
   - 🔗 [HTML & CSS Full Course for free 🌎](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=94yJ8zOR6frEp08x)  
   - 🔗 [JavaScript Full Course for free 🌐 (2024)](https://youtu.be/lfmg-EJ8gm4?si=xrx-_7iNQIp1rPUn)  

2. **school/** – Exercises, assignments, and projects from school learning.  

Each subfolder is organized by day or topic, containing hands-on practice files.  

## Goals  

- Build a solid foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- Reinforce concepts through **daily coding practice**  
- Track both **self-learning (Bro Code)** and **school exercises** in one place  
- Prepare for **frontend development** and move toward **fullstack projects**
